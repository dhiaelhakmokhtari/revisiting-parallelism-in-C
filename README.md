# ðŸ”§ C Programming Journey â€” From Basics to Parallelism

Welcome to my learning repository for the C programming language, where I progressively explore C fundamentals, pointer mastery, and dive deep into parallel programming using **POSIX threads** and **OpenMP**.

This repo contains clean, commented source files that reflect each step of my learning.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

### âœ… C Programming Basics
- Variables, conditionals, loops
- Functions and arrays
- Structs and pointers
- Static and dynamic memory
- File handling (TBD)

### âœ… POSIX Threads (`pthread`)
- Creating threads
- Passing parameters to threads
- Using mutexes to avoid race conditions
- Condition variables
- Reader/Writer problem
- Manager/Worker, Pipeline, and Producer/Consumer models

### âœ… OpenMP (Shared Memory Parallelism)
- Parallel regions
- Controlling the number of threads
- Parallel loops (`omp for`, `schedule`)
- Sections, master/single threads, critical blocks
- Locks and barriers
- Data sharing clauses: `private`, `shared`, `firstprivate`, `reduction`, etc.
